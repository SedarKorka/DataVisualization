Data Visualization for mortality Indicators in Luxembourg

The professor suggested that it would be more efficient to download the datasets directly using the provided links on the website. However, the source of the datasets was set up in a way that did not allow for copying the links. As a result, I had to download the datasets directly from the website. The datasets used in this study include: 'What causes contribute to mortality rates in Luxembourg', 'Non communication in Luxembourg', and 'Population by age group'. The links for these datasets are as follows: <a href="https://platform.who.int/mortality/countries/country-details/MDB/luxembourg">What causes contribute to mortality rates in Luxembourg, from the website "platform.who" </a>, <a href="https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/MDB/noncommunicable-diseases">Non communication in Luxembourg</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/age-structure">Population by age group, source "ourworldindata.org"</a>.
